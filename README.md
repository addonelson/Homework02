# <Horiseon Code Refactor>
## Description
- This project Motivation was brought on to help clean up and re-factor the code to help improve the sites accessibility and function. 
- I built this project to help improve my skillset in semantic elements.
- This page had broken links, and semantic element flow. All areas of the page are now working properly.
- Taking on this project I learned alot about how a page should be formatted, also how the css.style sheet co-exists and supports the html code to give your the desired look and functionality for the page.
